# Python_100_Days_Of_Code

These are some projects I have completed following along with Dr Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 course on Udemy, which can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

Not all completed projects have been added yet due to some being on an older computer. The ones here are mainly focused on web scrapping, or manipulation. However others have involved creating games, using APIs to fetch flight data or news headlings or creating a simple fitness tracker and storing the information on Google Sheets.
